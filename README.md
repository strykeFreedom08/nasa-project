The NASA Mission Control project is a web application that allows users to schedule mission launches, view upcoming launches, and explore the history of past missions. Built with React for a dynamic frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend, the application efficiently handles API requests and mission data. MongoDB serves as the database, ensuring seamless storage and retrieval of mission records. The project is containerized using Docker for consistency across environments and deployed on AWS EC2 for scalability and reliability. This modern tech stack provides an interactive and user-friendly platform for managing space missions, making space exploration data easily accessible. ðŸš€
